# Scott Yang's Body of Work (Incomplete)

## Shopify Dev Degree - Training Path
The [Shopify Dev Degree](https://devdegree.ca) program is a work-integrated learning program that combines an accredited Computer Science degree with hands-on development experience at Shopify. The Training Path makes up the first 8 months of the Dev Degree experience and is geared towards equipping students with essential technical and non-technical skills to be impactful on future placement teams.

The Training Path consists of the four primary courses below:
- DEV - Programming Fundamentals
- FED - Frontend Development, JavaScript/TypeScript, React.js
- DATA - Databases
- RAILS - Backend Development, Ruby on Rails

Following my conclusion of the Training Path at the end of April 2023, I will immediately be joining the Rails in Core team - a subteam under the Ruby & Rails Infrastructure umbrella.

Tools & Technologies: Git/GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, React Native, Ruby on Rails, SQL, MySQL.

Concepts Learned: Test Driven Development, Object Oriented Programming, Debugging, MVC Architecture, CRUD, REST, Entity Relational Diagrams/Cardinalities
